# The Market for the African Software Developer

## Background
The title of this work is something of a misnomer as the reader will discover in the developing narrative. However, it is obviously deliberate and is probably a failed attempt at trolling, but it encapsulates a direct response to all those agents and principals who continue to evaluate the nature of the job and talent market of `African` software developers based on a premise whose Boolean value is not dissimilar from the main theme of [The Flat Earth Society](https://www.tfes.org), an organization that continues to  promote a fallacy across the world against centuries of scientific and empirical evidence. 

Here are the _fascinating_ ideas these entities have propagated across digital media:

- [African Slavery](https://nairametrics.com/artificial-intelligence-andela-and-africas-looming-technology-slavery-3-2/) risks being repackaged and reborn as global software and technology continue to advance at a breakneck pace, leaving the question of the economic development of Africa blowing in the wind.
- [A business whose mission is to train and export African software developers to the western hemisphere](https://nairametrics.com/artificial-intelligence-andela-and-africas-looming-technology-slavery-3-2/) effectively lowers the software development cost of its client companies, enabling them to remain globally competitive. (Caveat: do not assume `western hemisphere` here to be a proxy for any entity that can afford to pay international prices for high quality software work, regardless of its GPS co-ordinates)
- A corollary of point 2 above is that this [export business activity](https://nairametrics.com/artificial-intelligence-andela-and-africas-looming-technology-slavery-3-2/) is not local market friendly, essentially harms local businesses' competitiveness and considerably weakens their ability to access cheap local talent, crowding them out of the market for high quality software work. An interesting phrase has been coined to describe and possibly provide a measure of this market dynamic - [_Ecosystem Impact Assessment (EIA)_](https://nairametrics.com/much-ado-nothing-andela-uproar/).
- What follows is that strategies adopted by a company that specializes in the described business area to meet its obligations and commitments to foreign clients, strategies such as hiring out elite (not in-house trained) developers for export, [creates imbalances within the identified ecosystem](https://nairametrics.com/much-ado-nothing-andela-uproar/), yielding a negative EIA value and, in the larger society, a significant nuisance value.
- There is a linear relationship between the narrowness of the hiring funnel of a company and the economic value it adds/subtracts to/from its country of operations. If a company - _in this case a software company_ - has depressingly low hiring rates - below 1% - this [does not add economic value](https://nairametrics.com/artificial-intelligence-andela-and-africas-looming-technology-slavery-3-2/) to its country of operations; therefore there exists a causative arrow from high hiring rates to accretive domestic economic value.

We hesitate to include private perspectives from closed messaging forums as they are not open to public scrutiny and the full context of comments and rebuttals may never be appreciated. 

We have put in a lot of effort to keep this piece _as simple as possible but not simpler_. Developing the main ideas from first principles and staying as close to primary sources as possible, let us begin. 

## Distributed Networks and Scale
This is surely not a technical paper on `distributed systems` but a cursory understanding of the topic forms an important mental model for carefully evaluating the issues at hand. We shall not shy away from the _seemingly_ complex issues that would enlighten the conversation further.

The geometry of the network (more correctly, _topology_) of the Internet is [distributed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dxcc6ycZ73M). Natural approximations of distributed systems can be found in many biological systems like the `brainless slime mold`, which evidently predate the Internet. The fundamental computing unit of a distributed network is a node. For simplicity, we shall go ahead and conflate human operators and intelligent (and dumb) devices as nodes. What does this arrangement of transacting participants afford its users? 

- there is `no single point of failure`; if one of Netflix's many web services falter, this event does not stop the reader from looking up extra materials on distributed systems on Google. Netflix services may be down but Google will respond to your query. Netflix and Google have millions of nodes deployed on the Internet.
- the movement of data across the Internet is not `centrally planned` - there is no centralized arbiter and the best pathway from origin to destination is algorithmically computed at the instant the system is required to move data from node to node. 
- save for communist China and a couple others on the fringe of censorship (which can still be subverted), there are `no barriers` to the transmission and reception of data on the Internet. The Internet `flattens geographies`, giving little meaning to national boundaries and regional lines.
- advances in the supporting infrastructure of distributed networks from `cloud computing` to outstanding degrees of `automation` have made it possible to `scale almost any idea` to billions of people on the planet. 

One of the direct implications of these assertions is that any arbitrage that would traditionally exist among pricing structures for various services in brick-and-mortar settings due to little or no information will now exist in an online business area only if a `node` (read here, a participating entity on the network) is unaware of what obtains on the distributed network for such services or, for some other reason beyond rational analysis, has chosen to be willfully ignorant - a dumb endpoint.

A simple analogy. Two hypothetical software developers, Alice and Bob, with the same skill sets basically have very similar potentials but the realization of these potentials is a function of how much network information they are able to extract and create value from and how consistently they are able to do this over time spent on the network. Alice, aware of the huge possibilities may position herself properly, advertise her portfolio of services on a personal website and social media, consistently deliver high quality on remote jobs, actively contribute to the value of the network through [various means](https://github.com) and generally increase (and improve) her visibility on the network. Bob, on the other hand, while possessing similar intrinsic value may never codify these abilities on the network nor contribute these abilities to the overall network value - but continues to remain locally (geographically) relevant. One has leveraged the compounding effects and configurations of the network to increase her value while the other has unconsciously decided to restrict his sphere of relevance to his geographical location regardless of the characteristics of the network of which he is a member. While located in the same geographical region and possessing very similar skill sets, two software developers, by their selfish choices, have sharply diverged in their actual value with respect to the network, in this case, the observer.

### From Nodes to Clusters
Our example of locally similar nodes attracting widely different premiums on the network can be extrapolated to clusters of nodes and resources on the same network. An emergent property of distributed networks is that they tend to self-organize - motivated, high-value nodes may aggregate and increase their perceived value to the network so that _the whole [cluster] becomes greater than the sum of its parts_. Being a distributed network, there is also an added feature known as the `power-law effect` which is a natural result of this aggregation of high-value resources. Italian sociologist and philosopher `Vilfredo Pareto` laid the first foundations of power-law effects from his observations in income distributions and ultimately originated the generalized 80/20 rule which is now observable in fields and systems as varied as physics and financial markets. 

Power-law effects, for the case in point, mean that a cluster of nodes on the network contributes a disproportionate amount of value and resources to the network relative to its size. It also implies that this cluster extracts an outsized value from the network. Value extracted can range from pecuniary rewards to intangibles like goodwill and brand recognition. The morality and fairness of the equation - contribution versus gains - of this interaction between a cluster and its enveloping network is not the thrust of this work. It would also help to keep in mind that the general progress of distributed networks has depended on more than a mere `consensus of the majority`. Adaptability and flexibility get higher marks. The techniques and algorithms for achieving distributed consensus are not within the scope of this work, the curious reader is referred to [resources] [and] [materials] [here].

The high-value nodes and resources available to clusters also strengthen their reach and impact. This planetary scale characteristic engenders a self-reinforcing cycle that adds more value to the already very valuable cluster, sparking an unintended consequence of inequalities in the network.

## The Open Source Movement and the Theory of the Firm
In 1937, British economist Ronald Coase published a treatise on _The Nature of the Firm_ and lit up the discussion on why firms emerge, explaining that they are clusters of resources and agents who interact through top-down command systems rather than market-based channels. In relation to this theory, Coase also floated the term, _transaction costs_ - the costs of interfacing with the market system.
